                            I was born on January 1st 2000 to Hayley Dawson and Garry Ayrton.<br> Unfortunatley due to the curcumstances of my birth I was then placed in the Frimley Park Intensive Care Unit to help me with the last 3 months of my development
                            because I was meant to be born in the March of 2000. <br> This placed a lot of stress on my parents as it was quite a shock that I was born so early and yet still able to survive. (With the help of the ICU.)<br> Finally able
                            to come out of hospital in April, I was then free to begin my life like everyne else without being attatched to machines and on constant watch by doctors.<br>

                            During my first few years I would imagine that it was quite scary for my parents because neither of them had ever dealt with someone with CP before and as a result I can imagine that it was quite a learning experience with a steap learning curve.<br>                            As I was slowly developing my parents noticed that I was not able to really move my legs or move around at all for that matter, this caused them to get a little bit worried as to what was going on.<br> I am told that when I
                            was a baby I didn't tend to move around, apparently I just lay in one spot normally without trying to crawl or walk, and when I did try to crawl it was quite a struggle as I did not have the leg strength to keep myself upright.<br>                            My parents took me to the doctors when I was around 2 years old to see if there was any major issues and after I was tested for a whole bunch of things the doctors finally concluded that I had Cerebral Palsy and that was why
                            I was taking so ling to develop any sort of lower body strength.<br> At first my parents were told that I would slowly develop and find ways of getting around which included walking (originally they thought I would never be
                            able to walk as a reasult of my CP, I finally did end up learning to walk but it was not till the age of 4.<br> After I had sort of learned to walk I was giveen walking aids to help and make it easier for me to get around.<br>                            The rest of my first few years were pretty uneventful, I went to school like a normal child and tried my best to enjoy life to the best of my ability that was getting stronger the older that I got.

                            As I said before the rest of my first few years were pretty average, that is untill I got to around the age of 7, when I reached the age of 7 things started to change for me in quite a big way.<br> To cut a long story short,
                            when I was around 7 my Mum was arrested right in front of me and set to prison for 10 or so years for possesion of a Class A substance with intent to supply.<br> When this happened my entire life was turned upside down basiclly

                        <p class="story-paragraphs">
                            My teeage years are quite a long story too but I will try my best to condence it down.<br>
                            Starting out with being 13 it was the year that started me out on the path that would eventually turn me into the person that I am today.<br>
                            So from the age of 7 up until I was 13 I had been living with my Step-Dad Marten after my Mum Hayley went to prison, the time that I was living with my Dad were easily the best years of my childhood,
                            my Dad always looked after and cared for me like I was his own and I owe a lot of the kind of person that I am today to my Dad.<br>
                            I got to do some really amazing things while living with my Dad like go to America and explore New York City, my Dad taught me to ride a pushbike, he even taught me to ride a
                            Motorcrossbike and how to do things like build fires outside.<br>
                            My Dad always pushed me to be the best version of myself.<br>
                            But unfortunatley when I was 13 I thought that I was big and clever and I moved out of my Dad's to go and live back with my Mum who had supposedly sorted herself out and was out of prison
                            at this point, so when she offered for me to go and live with her again I jumped at the chance, (this is a decision that I would very quickly come to regret.)<br>
                            So from the ages of 13 to 15 I lived back with my Mum, from day 1 I started to think that I had made a bad choice because it was not like I had imagined it, I like to think of it as a case
                            of me thinking that the grass waas greener on the other side of the fence but it wasn't, if anything the grass was darker on the other side of the fence.<br>
                            So at the age of 15 I decided to move out of my Mum's house and move on, so I packed up all that I could carry and made for my school.<br>
                            When finally at my school I was able to get some help with moving on and before I new it I was going to stay with my Auntie and that was that, finally after 2 years of not feeling like myself I
                            began to feel good again, I then spent the next month at my Aunties trying to get myself back on my feet.<br>
                            I was able to get myself on to a hpusing list and then I moved into shared accomodation with live in landlords where Iwould spend the next 2 years, slowly learning to live and survive on my
                            own.

                            This more or less brings us to the Present Day.<br>
                            At this moment in time I am really happy with where I am and how I am feeling, I am living in a different shared accomodation that I was before, with this accomodation I am free to do as I
                            please and focus on anything that I please.<br>
                            I am currently working at CurrysPCWorld and during my free time I am teaching myself guitar and along side that I am taking the Code Institute Online Fullstack Web Developer Course which
                            I hope to complete and use as a basis for a career in Software Development in the future.
