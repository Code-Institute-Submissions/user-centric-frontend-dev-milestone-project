                    <p class="home-paragraphs">
                        My name is Will Penrose and I am curretly training to become a Level 5 Full Stack Web Developer using Code Institute.<br>
                        I hope to one day make a career out of being a Software Developer whether that is working for a company like Apple, Facebook or Twitter, or whether I decide to take the freelance option
                        as a hireable Web Developer.<br>
                        During my spare time I like to read comic books as I am a big fan of superheroes from both Marvel and DC Comics, with my pewrsonal favourite superhero being Spider-Man.<br>
                        My other prefered pass times are going to the gym, playing guitar.<br>
                        I suffer from a disability called Cerebral Palsy (CP for short), having this disability affects my ability to walk and it also means that my balance isn't quite what is should be but I am able to manage,
                        one of the reasons I got to the gym is to try and strengthen my lowerbody in order to improve my codition and help with my overall balance.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="paragraph-heading">A Brief History</h3>
                    <p class="home-paragraphs">
                        I was born on January 1st 2000 at Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey.<br>
                        I was born about 3 months early so as a result I was put straight into the ICU and then wasn't able to bwe released from hospital until the April of 2000.<br>
                        It wasn't until I was about 2 years old that I was diagnosed with CP, due to being told that I have CP I did not walk until the age of 4 and even then it took a very long while for mw to become cofident,
                        I was able to get sround by using walking aids such as frames or even things like door frames to help keep me steady.<br>
                        My childhood was quite a wild ride, I went from living with my Mum until the age of 7 and then I moved in with my Dad and younger brother Cooper until the age of 13, at which time I moved back in with my
                        Mum until I was 15.<br>
                        Finally I moved out of livng eith my Mum and moved into accommodation funded by the group known as Step By Step which is where I am at this current time.
